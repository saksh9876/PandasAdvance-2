    "   - `iloc` is primarily integer-based indexing. It is used to select rows and columns from a DataFrame based on their integer positions (row and column numbers).\n",
    "   - When using `iloc`, you specify the row position(s) and column position(s) you want to access, separated by a comma.\n",

Window functions are powerful tools for performing operations that involve looking at a group of rows in relation to a current row.\n",

    "   - Common window operations include calculating moving averages, calculating rolling sums, and applying custom functions to a sliding window of data.\n",
    "   - You can use the `rolling()` function to create a rolling window object, and then you can apply various aggregation functions like `mean()`, `sum()`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Expanding Windows:\n",
    "   - Expanding windows gradually include more rows over time as the window grows.\n",
    "   - Expanding windows are used to compute cumulative values over time.\n",
    "   - For each row, an expanding window function considers all the rows from the beginning of the DataFrame up to that row.\n",
    "   - You can use the `expanding()` function to create an expanding window object, and then you can apply various aggregation functions like `mean()`, `sum()`, etc.\n",
